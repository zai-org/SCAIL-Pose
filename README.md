# Pose Extraction & Rendering Code for SCAIL: Towards Studio-Grade Character Animation via In-Context Learning of 3D-Consistent Pose Representations
This repository contains the pose extraction & rendering code for **SCAIL (Studio-Grade Character Animation via In-Context Learning)**, a framework that enables high-fidelity character animation under diverse and challenging conditions, including large motion variations, stylized characters, and multi-character interactions.

## 📋 TODOs

- [x] **Inference Code for 3D Pose Extraction & Rendering**

- [x] **Inference Code for 3D Pose Retarget**

- [ ] **Inference Code for Multi-Human Pose Extraction & Rendering**


## 🚀 Getting Started
Change dir to this pose extraction & rendering folder if you are still in the main repo folder:
```
cd SCAIL-Pose/
```

### Weights Download
Download Pretrained Weights for pose extraction & rendering. The script below downloads [NLFPose](https://github.com/isarandi/nlf) (torchscript), [DWPose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DWPose) (onnx) and [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX) (onnx) weights. You can also download the weights manually and put them into the `pretrained_weights` folder.
```
mkdir pretrained_weights && cd pretrained_weights
# download NLFPose Model Weights
wget https://github.com/isarandi/nlf/releases/download/v0.3.2/nlf_l_multi_0.3.2.torchscript
# download DWPose Model Weights & Detection Model Weights
mkdir DWPose
wget -O DWPose/dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/resolve/main/dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx
wget -O DWPose/yolox_l.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/yzd-v/DWPose/resolve/main/yolox_l.onnx
cd ..
```

The weights should be formatted as follows:
```
pretrained_weights/
├── nlf_l_multi_0.3.2.torchscript
└── DWPose/
    ├── dw-ll_ucoco_384.onnx
    └── yolox_l.onnx
```

### Environment Setup
We recommand using [openmmlab](https://github.com/open-mmlab) for the environment setup. The following commands are used to create a conda environment and install the required packages. You can refer to the official openmmlab [installation guide](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details.
```
conda create --name openmmlab python=3.8 -y
conda activate openmmlab
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.1"
```
For other dependencies, please use the `requirements.txt` file. You can refer to [taichi-lang](https://www.taichi-lang.org) for rendering environment troubleshooting.
```
conda activate openmmlab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 🦾 Usage
Default Extraction & Rendering:
```
python NLFPoseExtract/process_pose.py --subdir <path_to_the_example_pair> --resolution [512, 896]
```
Extraction & Rendering using 3D Retarget:
```
python NLFPoseExtract/process_pose.py --subdir <path_to_the_example_pair> --use_align --resolution [512, 896]
```
